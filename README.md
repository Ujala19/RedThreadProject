# RedThreadProject- Inventory Management System
This project is a Python-based command-line application designed to help users efficiently manage and monitor product inventory. It enables users to add new items, view current stock, update item details, and search for products, while ensuring that all data is saved for future use.
It helps us identify obstacles, stay consistent, and ultimately boosts our productivity. 
This project will be completed individually and will demostrate the use of procedural programming concepts, file handling, etc.
